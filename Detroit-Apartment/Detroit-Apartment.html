                <p class="secondary"> This period in my life was an interesting experience. I had zero clue what I was doing, I had no money, I had no job. 
                    It was one of the biggest decisions of my life that I still regret to this day. The one thing that I cherish is how you treated me. 
                    You didn't judge me, you'd spend any freetime you had with me. And you helped me when I hit a low point in my life, got a ticket and was late on rent.
                    You gave me your own hard earned money. When I had nothing, you gave up your own hardwork to help me. And to this day there's nothing I can do to repay you.
                    It was the most heartwarming gift I could ever receive. And it wasn't even the money. It was your urge to want to help me when I was lost in my life.
                    Every single day since then, you've been helping me find my way back. To this day you never give up on me, and you continue to support me in everything in my life.
                    I am so in love with you Sofia, and I've never loved anything or anyone as much as I love you. 💗
