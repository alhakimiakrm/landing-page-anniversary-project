                <p class="secondary"> The biggest change in my life! Even though I've moved out before, this was the more thought out deccision. Now, I'm still broke, but at least I'm functionally broke.
                    Of course, unsurprisingly, you were there to support me. You help me with my finances, grocery shopping. You help me clean my apartment when it would get dirty. And any time that you do have,
                    you spend it with me. We cook, we watch movies, sometimes we just do nothing (and I know that's not always fun). Point is, you have helped me stay sane in these 
                    crazy and chaotic 5 months. I get lonely very quickly, as you may know, but you always make sure attention is being paid to me. And for that I am so thankful.
                    I know I don't always show it, but I truly appreciate everything that you do. I know that you sacrifice a lot to make me happy, and to make our relationship work. I want you 
                    to know that I recognize it. I see everything that you do. And I love you so much for it. I can't wait to make more memories with you. 🤍
